# VA Project

## Purpose

Hi, this project is part of my journey at the University of Bordeaux.
It helped me understand various concepts and provided me with new skills:
- Web languages: HTML and CSS
- Building a web server in JavaScript
- Concepts of static and dynamic servers
- HTTP protocol
- Managing a database with PostgreSQL (Relational Algebra)
- Creating a session system

## Current State

Obviously, there are many errors in this project, and nowadays, of course, no one makes a web server without using a framework. Maybe I will improve it one day with my current and future skills for fun, but for now, I like the idea of having a school project as a reminder.

## Credits

This project came from [Vanilla Academy](https://vanillacademy.com) directed by Prof. Xavier Blanc, to whom I am very thankful.

This code is not a correction of the exercises from my teacher's website because I added a bunch of personal features to train myself and for fun, of course.
